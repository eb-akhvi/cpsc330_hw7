    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are likely to be more informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling include: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes, new-line characters, or any other non-informative characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- replacing urls, email addresses, or numbers with generic tokens such as \"URL\",  \"EMAIL\", \"NUM\". \n",

    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you finalize the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data in a CSV and work with this CSV so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n",
